# <font color=A6AFBE>What metrics would you use for Airbnb’s Experiences feature?

## <font color=EAC493>Answer Structure
1. Ask clarifying questions to confirm your assumptions 
<br>(e.g., What does the product do? Who is the product for?)
2. State or verify with the interviewer what the goal of the feature is 
<br>(e.g., to increase conversion, revenue, profits, sales, engagement, retention, or other?).
3. Use the user journey map to drive your analysis of what to measure. 
<br>(e.g., Think of what to measure when the user opens the app or opens a feature and interacts with it.)
4. At each stage, identify behaviours that can be quantified with a metric(s).
5. Provide criteria to prioritize the metrics.
6. Summarize your analysis.

## <font color=EAC493>Answer Example
##### <font color=99CCFF> clarify the function of feature
INTERVIEWEE: Okay, first I want to confirm that my understanding of Airbnb Experiences is correct. Is Experiences a new feature that lets travelers book a wide range of activities as part of their travel plans

INTERVIEWER: That’s right.

##### <font color=99CCFF> clarify the goal 
INTERVIEWEE: And, what is the overall goal of making this feature?

INTERVIEWER: Well, I would like you to tell me what you think the goal is?

INTERVIEWEE: Experiences is a new offering, which aligns with Airbnb’s mission to make travelers feel like they “belong anywhere.” So the goal of this feature seems to be to diversify Airbnb’s revenue stream with a complementary offer that appeals to its base. This additional revenue can come directly from people booking activities, or indirectly from people prolonging their stays especially if they book multi-day experiences.

INTERVIEWER: Yes, I agree.

##### <font color=99CCFF> clarify metrics - user map
INTERVIEWEE: The success of the Experiences feature in creating additional revenue depends on how well it appeals to two parties: the travelers that book Experiences activities and the providers of the activities. So, I would separate metrics into two sets. One set will measure how well the feature appeals to the demand side, the travelers. And, the other set will measure how well the feature appeals to the supply side, the providers. I would like to start with the demand.

INTERVIEWER: That sounds good. Let’s start with the demand side, and if there is time, we will go through the supply side too.

INTERVIEWEE: Ok. On the demand side, a basic metric to measure success is the number of bookings of activities. But, besides this general metric, I would be interested in evaluating this feature on how well it drives the user towards that conversion. This is important to course correct anything about the feature that is not working well. So, I would like to create a journey map of the user, identify which behaviours indicate success or failure towards conversion, and define metrics to measure them numerically. I will then prioritize the metrics based on two attributes: how core they are to evaluating success and how actionable they are. By actionable, I mean, if the metric provides insights to improve something about the product. After prioritizing the metrics, I will wrap up with my recommendation.

INTERVIEWER: That sounds good. Please proceed.
