# Evolution of a Product
### the phases of growing

{: .pull-right}

## early phase
During the first month, there is a scarcity of data, and what data you do have likely isn’t reliable or representative of the product’s long-term future. All monthly active users (MAUs) are also new users, and there is no churn or resurrection. *(Note: the total number of active users for a given time period is the sum of retention, resurrection and new users.)*

This changes in the second month. While there is still no resurrection, you are beginning to see churn from first-month users. 

In the third month, a balance between new users, churn and resurrection begins to emerge. Resurrection is small, and new users remain the largest factor, but churn has started to contribute significantly. *Your month-over-month net user growth depends entirely on the Quick Ratio: (new users + resurrected users) / churned users.*

Early on, churn far exceeds resurrection; this gap gradually narrows as the curves level out. (Note: for a weak product, the curves will not flatten out and will eventually reach zero, whereas for a strong product, the curves will begin to rise and will eventually flatten.)
